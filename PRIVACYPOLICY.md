## Overview
**Autotask Helper** ("the Extension") is designed to improve productivity within the Autotask platform. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, share, or transmit any user data.** 

*   **No Personal Information**: The Extension does not ask for or access personal information.
*   **No Tracking**: We do not track your browsing history or usage patterns.
*   **No Analytics**: The Extension does not include any analytics software or third-party tracking scripts.

## Permissions Usage
The Extension requests specific permissions solely to function:
*   **Host Permissions (`*.autotask.net`)**: To run scripts and detect URLs only on Autotask pages.
*   **Clipboard**: To copy cleaned URLs to your clipboard.
*   **Storage**: To save your local preferences (e.g., toggling features on/off).
